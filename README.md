# Spring Boot REST Api Project

A Spring Boot application that takes in a request from a client (Postman) and returns the query from a database (PostgreSQL) through a RESTful Api.

This project has now been updated to accomodate Thymeleaf and front end requests. 

This project is one of two spring boot applicaitons that work together to build a successful web client.
